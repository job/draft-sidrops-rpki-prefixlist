         This document defines a "Signed Prefix List", a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected content type for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to carry the complete list of prefixes which an Autonomous System (AS) may originate to all or any of its routing peers.
         The validation of a Signed Prefix List confirms that the holder of the listed ASN produced the object, and that this list is a current, accurate and complete description of address prefixes that may be announced into the routing system originated by this AS.

      <t>
        This document defines a "Signed Prefix List", a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <xref target="RFC5652"/> <xref target="RFC6268"/> protected content type to carry a list of IP address prefixes and an Autonomous System Number.
        The list of prefixes describes the maximal set of prefixes that the Autonomous System MAY announce to any of its routing peers.
        The content is signed by the holder of the RPKI private key associated with the listed ASN.
      </t>
      <t>
        RPKI Signed Prefix Lists allow other RPKI-validating remote routing entities to audit the collection of announcements that have the subject ASN as the originating AS.
        Any prefixes originated by this AS not contained in a validated Signed Prefix List SHOULD be regarded as ineligible, but ultimately their consequent handling by the local routing entity that performed the audit function is a matter of local policy.
      </t>
      <t>
        The intent of this object is to offer a RPKI-based successor to the <xref target="RFC2622"/> 'route-set' class objects used in Internet Routing Registries (IRRs).
        The semantics of the route-set and the Signed Prefix List are similar.
        The difference is that the RPKI signature allows a relying party to be assured of the currency and authenticity of the Signed Prefix List as a complete enumeration of all prefixes that may be announced as originating from this AS if the object can be validated by the RPKI.
      </t>
      <t>
        Signed Prefix List objects follow the Signed Object Template for the RPKI <xref target="RFC6488"/>.

        The IP address prefixes listed in a Signed Prefix List object is an enumeration of prefixes that may be announced as originating from the AS identified by the asID if the object can be validated by the RPKI (<xref target="validation"/>).
        The object does not implicitly permit a more-specific prefix subsumed by a listed IP address prefix to be originated by this AS.
        For any such more-specific prefix to be permitted by the Signed Prefix List object, it must be explicitly listed in the list of IP address prefixes.

      <name>Signed Prefix List Validation</name>
      <t>
        To validate a Signed Prefix List, the RP <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> perform all the validation checks specified in <xref target="RFC6488"/>.
        In addition, the RP <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> perform the following validation steps:

      <section title="Validated Signed-PrefixList Payload" anchor="VSP">
      <t>
        Normally there would be a single valid Signed Prefix List object for a given asID (see <xref target="operations"/>).
        However, multiple valid Signed Prefix List objects which contain the same asID could exist.
        In such cases, the union of the resulting address prefix members forms the complete set of members.
        The complete set (resulting from a single or multiple PrefixLists) is locally stored by a relying party, and such an object is called the Validated Signed-PrefixList Payload (VSP) for the asID in consideration.
        (Note: The VSP is akin to the Validated ROA Payload (VRP) for Route Origin Authorization (ROA) <xref target="RFC6811"/>.)
        For a given asID, if there is only a valid Signed Prefix List object with zero prefixes listed, then the VSP for the asID MUST show 'Empty' in place of the set of prefixes.

      </section>
      </section>
    
      <section title="Problems Solved by PrefixList" anchor="problems">
      <t>
        Given that a VSP exists for an asID, if a prefix route is announced whose origin AS matches the asID but the prefix is not listed in the VSP, then the route is considered Invalid per PrefixList verification.
        The network operator may consider such a route ineligible <xref target="RFC4271"/> for route selection, regardless of the route's RPKI Route Origin Validation (ROV) status <xref target="RFC6811"/>.
        Similarly, the operator may consider an ROV Invalid route ineligible for route selection, regardless of the route's PrefixList verification status.
        If the above stated policy is implemented, PrefixList verification solves the additional routing security problems listed below while ROV detects accidental prefix hijacks.
        More details concerning the procedures for PrefixList verification will be provided in a separate draft.
      </t>
      <ol>
        <li>
        <strong>AS Abuse While Hijacking an ROV-Unknown Prefix:</strong>
        If AS A creates a PrefixList, it is protected in case an offending AS X inserts AS A as the origin AS and hijacks a third-party prefix not covered by a ROA.
        </li>
        <!--
        The route will be ROV-Unknown and PrefixList Invalid and hence
        considered ineligible by an RP (see #6 in <xref target="state-space"/>).
        Thus, AS A protects itself from this form of AS abuse.
        -->
        <li>
        <strong>AS Abuse Together with a Bogus ROA:</strong>
        If AS A creates a PrefixList, it is protected in case an offending AS X inserts AS A as the origin AS and announces a prefix for which AS X has an RPKI certificate and a bogus ROA showing AS A as the origin.
        <!--
        The route will be ROV-Valid due to the bogus ROA but PrefixList Invalid
        and hence considered ineligible by an RP (see #3 in <xref target="state-space"/>).
        Thus, AS A protects itself from this second form of AS abuse as well.
        -->
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>AS Accidentally Strips AS_PATH and Mis-Originates Prefixes:</strong>
        An AS learns a route from an eBGP neighbor and announces the prefix to another eBGP neighbor as if it is being originated by it (i.e., strips the received AS_PATH and re-originates the prefix).
        This can be called re-origination or mis-origination (also see Type 5 route leak in <xref target="RFC7908"/>).
        This attack has been seen to happen in practice due to malfunctioning route optimizers.
        It is mitigated at neighboring ASes if the AS in consideration has registered a PrefixList.
        <!--  
        If the affected prefixes have ROA coverage, then ROV at a subsequent AS would detect this anomaly.
        However, if the affected prefixes do not have ROA coverage, then these prefixes
        will be ROV-Unknown and PrefixList Invalid and considered Invalid by an RP
        (per #6 in <xref target="state-space"/>) provided that the leaking AS has registered a PrefixList.
        Thus, a leaking AS protects itself in the sense that when the leaks (mis-originations) reach
        a neighbor AS that is doing PrefixList based verification, they will be detected and blocked
        from further propagation.
        -->
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Attack Surface Reduction:</strong>
        Often a prefix owner includes more prefixes and/or more more-specific prefixes (using maxLength or otherwise) in their ROA but has no plans to announce some or many of them.
        Due to this, they tend to create a larger attack surface for forged-origin prefix and/or subprefix hijacks.
        However, they would notify the operator of the AS serving them for origination purposes about the prefixes they do intend to announce, and the AS operator would include only those prefixes in the AS's PrefixList.
        This helps to reduce the attack surface for the forged-origin hijacks.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>AS can declare itself "Not Originating Prefixes in the Internet":</strong>
        PrefixList can be created with an empty list in it. In doing this, the AS is asserting that it is not originating prefixes in the Internet.
        Any route showing this AS as the origin AS is Invalid per PrefixList verification.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <section anchor="operations">
      <name>Operational Considerations</name>
      <t>
        It is highly <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that a compliant CA maintains a single Signed Prefix List for a given asID.
      </t>
      <t>
        If an AS holder publishes a Signed Prefix List, then relying parties SHOULD assume that the list is complete for that originating AS, and the presence of any route with the same AS as the originating AS and an address prefix that is not included in the Signed Prefix List implies that the route has been propagated within the routing system without the permission of the originating AS.
      </t>
      <t>
        The construction of an 'allowlist' for a given EBGP session using Signed Prefix List(s) compliments both best current practices <xref target="RFC7454"/> and the practice of rejecting RPKI-ROV-invalid BGP route announcements <xref target="RFC6811"/>.
        In other words, if a given BGP route is covered by a Signed Prefix List, but also is "Invalid" from a Route Origin Validation perspective, it is RECOMMENDED to reject the route announcement. Here the term "reject the route" is used in the sense of "consider the route ineligible for path selection" <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
      </t>

      <section title="EE Certificates">
        <t>
          The Certificate Authority (CA) <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> sign only one Signed Prefix List with each generated private key and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> generate a new key pair for each new version of a Signed Prefix List object.
          The CA <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> generate a new End Entity (EE) certificate for each signing of a particular Signed Prefix List.
          An associated EE certificate used in this fashion is termed a "one-time-use" EE certificate (see <xref target="RFC6487" section="3"/>).
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Object Filenames">
        <t>
          A guideline for naming Signed Prefix List objects is that the file name chosen in the repository be a value derived from the public key of the EE certificate.
          One such method of generating a publication name is described in <xref target="RFC4387" section="2.1"/>; convert the 160-bit hash of a EE's public key value into a 27-character string using a modified form of Base64 encoding, with an additional modification as proposed in Section 5, table 2, of <xref target="RFC4648"/>.

    <section anchor="security">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
        Relying Parties are warned that the data in a Signed Prefix List is self-asserted by the AS holder.
        There is no implied authority from any IP prefix holder that grants the AS permission to originate a route for any prefixes.
        Such an authority is separately conveyed in the RPKI as a ROA.
      </t>
      <t>
        While a one-time-use EE certificate must only be used to generate and sign a single Signed Prefix List object, CAs are not technically restricted from generating and signing multiple different Signed Prefix List objects with a single key pair.
        Any Signed Prefix List objects sharing the same EE certificate cannot be revoked individually.

      <name>Implementation status</name>
      <t>
        This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942.
        The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
        Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
        Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
        This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
        Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.
      </t>
      <t>
        According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
        It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".
      </t>
